180, 3.8.2, "Missing closing bracket in \|\|g(x_1) - g(x_2 **)** \|\| &leq; ..."
181, 3.8.2, "Since the Jacobian is continuous, there exists a delta such that J_f(x) &neq; 0 for all x in the ball with the radius delta. Not r"
286, 4.6.1, "the result is 32/375, not 32/125. The rest is ok"
294, 5.1, "The correction is incorrect and not needed. The absolute value comes into place when integrating by area. Before that it is fixed automatically by the bounds"
317, 5.1.27, "The 2nd line of integration should be kr^2(r^2+b^2-2br cos t). The end result is correct since the cos is 0"
